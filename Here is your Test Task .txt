This is your test task:
    Please create a single webpage of TreeGrid, host the demo online, so that we can test it remotely.
    We DON'T set deadline for your test task, because, we want you take your time to deliver a 100% PERFECT demo - instead of buggy / incomplete demo(s).
    Please use Syncfusion EJ2 Angular TreeGrid (free trial version), but it doen't support all required features, so, you HAVE to write custom code.
    Please implement the task ONLY with Angular (front end) + Node.js (back end) + TypeScript (for both FE & BE).
    We carefully designed this test task to be SELF-explanatory, ambiguity free, please let us know if you see any room for improvement.
    Please accept this test task ONLY if you are confident to implement it 100% (word for word in this TXT) -- not 98%, not 99%!
    After you complete the test task 100%, you SHALL became qualifed candidate for our large project(s), we will sign outsourcing contract with you ASAP.
    Please add your test task billable hours into the project contract, we shall pay for your test task when we sign the contract, NOT otherwise!

You may borrow sample code: https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/treegrid/virtual, and all "Angular TreeGrid" samples.
Initially, your TreeGrid shall have 10K rows (RowID=1,2,3...10K), all users shall edit this single TreeGrid (a JSON file on server), all users' row-edits and column-settings are PERSISTENT between all users.
This TreeGrid shall ALWAYS occupy user's browser full-screen (at any size), enable Vertical & Horizontal default-scroll-bars, but no Pager bar (i.e. single page).
This TreeGrid shall be fully responsive on BOTH the PC browser (keyboard+mouse) and Mobile touchscreen (fingers).
Please test your demo on all platform browsers to confirm it is FULLY responsible: PC, Android, and iOS.

Please implement 2 Context Menus on this TreeGrid:
(Note:  Certain menu item has üóπ symbol  - meaning this item shall function as On/Off switch. It always show current On/Off status using EITHER üóπ or ‚òê )

Context Menu 1 - Right-click (mouse) or long-press (mobile) a "Column Header", to pop-up 7 menu items:
    EditCol: User can set (via dialog) a column's Name, Data-Type (Text/Num/Date/Boolean/DropDownList), Default-Value (of current DataType), 
                    Minimum-Column-Width (when screen shrinked), Font-size, Font-color, Background-color, Alignment, Text-wrap ‚òë.
                    (When user changes a Data Type, system converts all data under this column. If a data failed to convert: just replace it with Default Value of new Data Type)
    NewCol: User can Create a new column (via dialog similar to EditCol), SAVE will create the new Column, CANCEL will not.
    DelCol: User can Delete a column (with confirmation), such delete cannot be undone, (user can also Drag-n-drop to Reorder & Resize columns).
    ChooseCol: User can show/hide (via dialog) any columns from a list of all columns. See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/columnchooser
    FreezeCol ‚òë: Enable Freeze all-left-side (including current) columns, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/frozen-column
                               (When turning Freeze On, please switch from Virtual Scroll to Infinite Scroll to avoid a conflict in library. Freeze Off shall switch back to Virtual Scroll)
    FilterCol ‚òë: Enable "Filter Bar" in Parent Hierarchy Mode, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/filter
    MultiSort ‚òë: Enable Multi-Sort for columns, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/sorting

Context Menu 2 - Rright-click (mouse) or long-press (mobile) a "Row", to pop-up 9 menu items:
    AddNext; AddChild; DelRow; EditRow: User can Add(Next)/Add(Child)/Del/"Dialog-Edit" a row, (user can also Drag-n-drop to Move multi-selected rows).
    MultiSelect ‚òë: Enable user to "Multi-select" rows on PC and Mobile, See https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/demos/#/bootstrap5/treegrid/selection
    CopyRows; CutRows: Copy/Cut multi-selected rows - similar to how MS Windows File Explorer copy/cut Files (leaf rows) and Folders (non-leaf rows).
    (The rows being Copied/Cut shall be highlighted in Pink color, but not removed yet, until user perform Paste)
    PasteNext: Insert the copied/cut Rows as "next siblings" of the current row
    PasteChild: Insert the copied/cut Rows as "children" of the current row
    (Copy+Paste will auto-generate new RowIDs, because all RowIDs are unique in TreeGrid)
